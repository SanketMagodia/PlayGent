# PlayGent

**Vision: To build a premier, open-source, community-driven platform for reliving classic Game Boy Advance experiences directly in your browser.**

PlayGent aims to be more than just an emulator; it's a commitment to creating an accessible, customizable, and high-performance retro gaming hub. We believe in the power of open collaboration to build a platform that is both a joy to use and a testament to the timeless appeal of GBA games.

## Current Implementation

The platform is already taking shape with a focus on user experience and core functionality:

while the current implementation is functional, we are keen to see it improved. We warmly welcome contributions that enhance the design, optimize performance, or refine the architecture.

* **Clean & Modern UI:** A thoughtfully designed interface that is intuitive and focuses on the gaming experience, built with React.
* **Extensive Game Library:** Pre-configured access to over 40 classic GBA titles, ready to play.
* **Theming Capabilities:** Personalize your gaming environment with theme options to suit your style.
* **Persistent Progress:** Robust save and load state functionality allows you to pick up your game exactly where you left off, ensuring your adventures are never lost.
* **Responsive Design:** Enjoy gaming on various screen sizes, with adaptive UI elements.

## Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** React (JavaScript/TypeScript) for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
* **Backend (`playapi`):** FastAPI (Python) for efficient and scalable delivery of game assets and related services.

## We Need You: A Call to the Community

PlayGent is at an exciting stage. While the foundation is strong, its true potential can only be unlocked through community involvement. We are looking for passionate developers, designers, retro gaming enthusiasts, and testers to help us:

* **Expand the Game Library:** Integrate more emulators and improve compatibility.
* **Enhance Features:** Implement new functionalities like controller support, netplay, cheat code integration, and advanced customization options.
* **Refine the UI/UX:** Continuously improve the user interface and overall user experience.
* **Strengthen the Backend:** Optimize API performance, security, and scalability.
* **Improve Emulator Core:** Work on or integrate more advanced emulation cores for better accuracy and performance.
* **Documentation & Testing:** Help us build comprehensive documentation and ensure the platform is robust and bug-free.

If you're excited by the prospect of building the ultimate open-source GBA emulation platform, we invite you to contribute. Whether it's through code, design, feedback, or simply spreading the word, your participation is invaluable.
